  I am an IT student currently pursuing my studies in the management stream, with a focus on Computer Science, Math, and Economics. I have a deep interest in technology, particularly in areas like game development, ethical hacking, and app development. I enjoy solving problems and prefer to experience challenges as a way to grow, rather than striving for perfection right away.
Iâ€™m working on multiple projects, including designing a 3D horror game for Android and creating a personalized website that showcases my designs, skills, and progress across different fields. I also run a YouTube channel, SURU, where I share Mobile Legends: Bang Bang gameplay in Nepali, focusing on Fanny and esports.
In my free time, I create music in the Phonk genre and enjoy exploring new technologies like Firebase, Godot, and Bubble for app development. Iâ€™m always experimenting with new ideas to improve my personal and professional growth. My mission is to stay ahead of the curve and share my journey authentically with others.
