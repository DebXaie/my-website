  I am an IT student currently pursuing my studies in the management stream, with a focus on Computer Science, Math, and Economics. I have a deep interest in technology, particularly in areas like game development, ethical hacking, and app development. I enjoy solving problems and prefer to experience challenges as a way to grow, rather than striving for perfection right away.
I’m working on multiple projects, including designing a 3D horror game for Android and creating a personalized website that showcases my designs, skills, and progress across different fields. I also run a YouTube channel, SURU, where I share Mobile Legends: Bang Bang gameplay in Nepali, focusing on Fanny and esports.
In my free time, I create music in the Phonk genre and enjoy exploring new technologies like Firebase, Godot, and Bubble for app development. I’m always experimenting with new ideas to improve my personal and professional growth. My mission is to stay ahead of the curve and share my journey authentically with others.
